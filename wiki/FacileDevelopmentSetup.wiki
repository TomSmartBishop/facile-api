#summary Basic setup when devloping the Facile API

= Basics =

This is my development setup, it should work for you too:

  * Windows7
  * JDK 1.6x
  * Eclipse 3.7
    * All required configurations can be found in the Eclipse 'Run' and 'External Tools' dialog.
      * For 'External Tools' -> 'Run ILAsm' you need a binary of ILAsm (comes with Visual Studio)


= Run Configurations in Eclipse =
  * Facile (select assembly): Read a dedicated assembly (full refelction) - this configuration is good for debugging a specific assembly.
  * Facile(select assembly and pdb): The same as before but allows the additional specification of a program debug database, so that it additionally process Visual Studio debug information.
  * Facile IL Dump: Test configuration... will read the specifid assembly and writes it as decompiled ILAsm program to the console. I use it to test the ILAsmRender implmentation: If everything works correctly you can use this output to rebuild the program with ILAsm

= Unit Test Configurations in Eclipse =
  * Facile Basic Test Suite: Runs all basic unit tests (reading and decoding binary formats, decompiling all registered versions of mscorlib and some addtional basic tests)
  * Facile GAC Test Suite: Reads (reflects, decompiles) all assemblies of your local Windows GAC. Errors will be dumped to the output...!
  * Local Drive Test Suite: Will scann all drives and directories for assemblies and will decompile it. Errors will be dumped to the output...!

Especially the last two configurations are good to test the coverage and make sure that the reflection is working as expected.

= External Tools Configurations in Eclipse =
  * Facile read output.txt: Opens a text editor to view the output of the last run, which is always dumped to output.txt - maybe you have to change the path or text editor of this configuration
  * Run ILAsm (select IL file): Run ILAsm to test if the decompiled output of facile can be compiled again (round tripping) - this is still in development..!

= Additional =

Sometimes a program like Total Commader http://www.totalcmd.net/ is useful to copy assemblies from the GAC to a desired location!
