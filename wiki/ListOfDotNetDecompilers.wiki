= List of .Net Decompilers =


== dotPeek ==

dotPeek is a new free .NET decompiler from JetBrains

http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/NETPEEK


== .NET CodeReflect ==

DevExtras .NET CodeReflect is a simple yet advanced free .NET assembly browser/decompiler. It is a free alternative to Red Gate's/Lutz Roeder's .NET Reflector.

In case of obfuscated method bodies the C# implementation will be skiped. IL code looks good.

== RedGate Reflector ==

Long time ago this was known as Lutz Roeder's .Net Reflector.

== telerik JustDecompile ==

A nice feature of this decompiler is that it can create a Visual Studio C# project file for you. It is not always possible, but still a good idea.

My first tests with this tool showed that the C# code view often fails in case obfuscated code, where you will see exceptions like this:

   at Telerik.JustDecompiler.Decompiler.StatementDecompiler.(CatchHandlerData catch_data)
   at Telerik.JustDecompiler.Decompiler.StatementDecompiler.(ExceptionHandlerData data, TryStatement try)
   at Telerik.JustDecompiler.Decompiler.StatementDecompiler.(ExceptionHandlerData data)
   at Telerik.JustDecompiler.Decompiler.StatementDecompiler.(InstructionBlock block, InstructionBlock previous)
   at Telerik.JustDecompiler.Decompiler.StatementDecompiler.Â€(InstructionBlock block)
   at Telerik.JustDecompiler.Decompiler.StatementDecompiler.()
</pre>
</font>

But the IL view works properly...

== ILSpy ==

ILSpy is the open-source .NET assembly browser and decompiler.

Development started after Red Gate announced that the free version of .NET Reflector would cease to exist by end of February 2011.

== Dis# ==

The tool looks already a bit older, but has a nice feature called 'in-place editor', where you can rename variables...

== ILDasm ==

Microsoft's disassembler.

== LSW DotNet-Reflection-Browser ==

The interresting thing about this software is, that it (like facile) isn't written in a .Net language and does not rely at any point on the .Net reflection mechanism. According to their website it's written in SmallTalk.
