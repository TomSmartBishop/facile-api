= List of .Net Decompilers =

== Dotnet IL Editor (DILE) ==
I didn't test it by myself (so far), but it looks promising: http://sourceforge.net/projects/dile/
Hope to find some time to do that soon.

== dotPeek ==

dotPeek is a new free .NET decompiler from JetBrains

http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/NETPEEK

== .NET CodeReflect ==

DevExtras .NET CodeReflect is a simple yet advanced free .NET assembly browser/decompiler. It is a free alternative to Red Gate's/Lutz Roeder's .NET Reflector.

In case of obfuscated method bodies the C# implementation will be skiped. IL code looks good.

== RedGate Reflector ==

Long time ago this was known as Lutz Roeder's .Net Reflector.

== telerik JustDecompile ==

A nice feature of this decompiler is that it can create a Visual Studio C# project file for you. It is not always possible, but still a good idea.

My first tests with this tool showed that the C# code view often fails in case obfuscated code, where you will see exceptions like this:

   at Telerik.JustDecompiler.Decompiler.StatementDecompiler.(InstructionBlock block)
   at Telerik.JustDecompiler.Decompiler.StatementDecompiler.()
</pre>
</font>

But the IL view works properly...

== IL.View ==
Web-based decompiler, as source on github: https://github.com/DenisVuyka/IL.View
I have to take a closer look at that some time soon...

== ILSpy ==

ILSpy is the open-source .NET assembly browser and decompiler.

Development started after Red Gate announced that the free version of .NET Reflector would cease to exist by end of February 2011.

== Dis# ==

The tool looks already a bit older, but has a nice feature called 'in-place editor', where you can rename variables...

== ILDasm ==

Microsoft's disassembler.

== Assembly Analyzer ==

Another decompiler a la "Lutz Roeder": http://asmanalyzer.codeplex.com/
No test results until today... (sorry)

== LSW DotNet-Reflection-Browser ==

The interresting thing about this software is, that it (like facile) isn't written in a .Net language and does not rely at any point on the .Net reflection mechanism. According to their website it's written in SmallTalk.
